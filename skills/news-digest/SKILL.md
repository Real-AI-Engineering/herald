# News Digest

You have access to a daily curated news digest via the herald plugin.

## When to use

- User asks "what's new", "any news", "latest trends", "what happened today"
- User starts a session and a fresh digest is available
- User asks about specific topics that might be in today's digest

## How to check

1. Check if herald is initialized: `test -f ~/.herald/herald.db`
2. Generate brief:
   ```bash
   cd "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" && PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m herald.cli brief
   ```
3. If output has `story_count: 0` — no stories available

## Available commands

- `/news-init` — Set up the pipeline
- `/news-digest` — Read today's digest
- `/news-run` — Manually trigger collection
- `/news-status` — Show database statistics
- `/news-sources` — View configured sources
- `/news-add` — Add a news source

## Presenting the digest

When presenting items from the digest, use this **5-section Analysis Guide**:

1. **Trends** — Which topics are gaining momentum? What's signal vs. noise?
2. **Surprises** — What's unexpected or counter-intuitive?
3. **Connections** — How do items across different topics relate?
4. **Action Items** — What concrete next steps does this suggest?
5. **Questions** — What important questions does this raise?
