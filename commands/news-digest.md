You are presenting the user's daily news digest from herald v2.

## Steps

1. **Check setup**: Verify `~/.herald/herald.db` exists. If not: "Run `/news-init` first."

2. **Generate brief**:

```bash
cd "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" && PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m herald.cli brief
```

3. **Handle edge cases**:
   - No stories: "No stories available. Run `/news-run` to collect fresh articles."
   - Empty brief (only frontmatter): "No recent stories in the last 24 hours. Run `/news-run` to update."

4. **Present digest**: Read the output and present items using the **5-section Analysis Guide**:

   1. **Trends** — Which topics are gaining momentum? What's signal vs. noise?
   2. **Surprises** — What's unexpected or counter-intuitive?
   3. **Connections** — How do items across different topics relate?
   4. **Action Items** — What concrete next steps does this suggest?
   5. **Questions** — What important questions does this raise?

5. **Ask**: "Anything actionable here? I can help you dive deeper into any of these items."
